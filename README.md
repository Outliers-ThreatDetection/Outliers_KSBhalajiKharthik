# Threat Detection by Video Classification with Alert System

This repository contains the dataset and code for the Machine Learning model developed for the Honeywell Smart City Hackathon.

There are many ways to find whether a person is under threat. One way is to understand their gestures. We try to provide an enhanced security system using gesture recognition, which works by analyzing people's gestures and alerting the authorities on a real time basis.
